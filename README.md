In teams of 3 we had to implement a web application that is impervious to the most common web-based attacks and also can access and display data from remote web services. 
We had to generate SMS messages to and from a simulated circuit board, the circuit board components are:
- Four switches - on/off
- Fan - Forward/Reverse
- Heater - temprature
- Keypad - the last number entered

These current state of the components is to be embedded within a message string and the message transmitted via SMS to the EE M2M server which we have been able to create successfully. 

- We have also been able to use a PHP SOAP client to download SMS messages from the M2M Connect server. 
- Parse all downloaded messages.
- All content sucessfully validated. 
- Store the downloaded messages (content and metadata) in the database.
- Display the message content and metadata on the web-browser (time stamp). 
- Validated HTML 5 and CSS for the web-page layout/presentation.
- MVC architecture.
- Object Oriented PHP.
    - With followed SOLID guidlines.
- SLIM Micro-Framework. 
- Application of security techniques and avoidance of common web app vulnerabilities. 
- MySQL/Maria DB. 
- SOAP & WSDL file. 
- Completed DocBlock comments where needed. 
- Consistent Coding using PHP-FIG, PSR-1 & PSR-2 coding standards. 
- Use of Subversion Version Control Server. 

A possible extension we were able to complete were:

- The creation of a login page for registered users.
